## Introduction

We introduce the first large-scale real-world dataset with rich annotations of diverse driving preferences, addressing a key gap in personalized end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Using static road topology and a fine-tuned visual language model (VLM), we extract contextual features to construct fine-grained scenarios. Objective and subjective preference labels are derived through behavior analysis, VLM-based modeling, and human-in-the-loop verification. Building on this, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized E2EAD models. Experiments show that conditioning on preferences leads to behavior better aligned with human driving. Our work establishes a foundation for human-centric, personalized E2EAD.

## Qualitative Results on StyleDrive Benchmark

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/policycases.png" />
<p>Qualitative illustration of DiffusionDrive-Style predictions under different style conditions
across identical scenarios. Left: Aggressive vs. Normal; Right: Conservative vs. Normal. Red
lines indicate the model‚Äôs predicted trajectory under the given style condition; green lines denote the
ground-truth human trajectory. Clear behavioral differences emerge with style variation, reflecting
the model‚Äôs ability to adapt its outputs to driving preferences.</p>
